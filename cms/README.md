# Pack 170 CMS

The isolated content-management backend for Pack 170. It runs as the `macon170-cms` Cloudflare Worker at `https://cms.macon170.com` and owns its own D1 database (`macon170-cms`) and R2 media bucket (`macon170-cms-media`). It has no binding to, and makes no changes to, the public site's Worker or database.

Its first collection is **Volunteer leadership roster**. Each record is a role; names may be blank for vacant roles. Publish only the records approved for display.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- A Cloudflare account (free tier works great)
- Wrangler CLI (installed with dependencies)

### Installation

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Create the CMS D1 database:**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 create macon170-cms
   ```

   Copy the returned `database_id` into `wrangler.jsonc`.

3. **Create your R2 bucket:**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler r2 bucket create macon170-cms-media
   ```

4. **Run migrations:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate:local
   ```

5. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser:**
   Navigate to `http://kudzu:41772/admin` from any computer on the LAN to access the admin interface.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run deploy` - Deploy to Cloudflare
- `npm run db:migrate` - Run migrations on production database
- `npm run db:migrate:local` - Run migrations locally
- `npm run type-check` - Check TypeScript types
- `npm run test` - Run tests

## Admin access

SonicJS owns its user accounts in the CMS D1 database. The public registration and SonicJS development seed routes are disabled. Provision the initial administrator with a one-time, secret-backed operational procedure before inviting editors; never add a password or password hash to source control.

## Content API

The roster collection is served by SonicJS at `/api/content/leadership-roster`. Frontend integration is intentionally out of scope for this backend-only phase.

## Deployment

1. **Login to Cloudflare:**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler login
   ```

2. **Deploy the CMS Worker:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Run the CMS migrations on production:**
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate
   ```
